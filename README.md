I am a Senior Data and Models Solutions Associate in the Solutions Productization Department at KAPSARC.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Extreme Computing Research Center
at KAUST. I worked with David E. Keyes on developing scalable algorithms exploiting
data sparsity in dense matrices to bridge between architectures that are increasingly
memory-austere on a per-core basis and extreme-scale scientific applications.

Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Innovative Computing Laboratory
at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where I worked with Jack Dongarra on
developing algorithms for dense linear algebra on distributed, GPU-accelerated systems.
I was part of the world's leading Exascale Computing Project of the United States
Department of Energy: Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale
(SLATE, https://icl.utk.edu/slate/).

Before that, I was a Software Engineer at Saudi Electricity Company and Saudi Aramco.
