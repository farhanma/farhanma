I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the
[Extreme Computing Research Center (ECRC)](https://ecrc.kaust.edu.sa) at the
[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://kaust.edu.sa/en),
where I work with [David E. Keyes](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/david-keyes)
on developing scalable algorithms exploiting data sparsity. I am part of the
[Hierarchical Computations on Manycore Architectures (HiCMA)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/hicma)
research group.

Before I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the
[Innovative Computing Laboratory (ICL)](http://www.icl.utk.edu/) at the
[University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://utk.edu/), where I worked with
[Jack Dongarra](http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/) on developing
algorithms for dense linear algebra on distributed, GPU-accelerated systems.
I was part of the world's leading
[Exascale Computing Project (ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org/) of the
[United States Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/):
[Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale (SLATE)](http://icl.utk.edu/slate/).

My main contribution to open source is to the [SLATE](http://icl.utk.edu/slate/)
math library: [https://bitbucket.org/icl/slate/](https://bitbucket.org/icl/slate/).

I received PHD'19 and MS'13 in Computer Science from
[KAUST](https://kaust.edu.sa/en), where I was part of the
[ECRC](https://ecrc.kaust.edu.sa) working with
[David E. Keyes](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/david-keyes) on
developing performance-centric algorithms for high performance computing,
in the context of unstructured grid PDEs and the Fast Multipole Method.
My dissertation title is:
[unstructured computations on emerging architectures](https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/handle/10754/644902).

In a previous life, I was a Software Engineer at
[Saudi Electricity Company](https://www.se.com.sa/en-us/Pages/home.aspx) and
[Saudi Aramco](https://www.aramco.com/). Before that, I received BS'12 in
Computer Science from [King Faisal University (KFU)](https://www.kfu.edu.sa/sites/Home/Default.aspx).
