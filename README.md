Mohammed Al Farhan is a computer scientist specialized in scientific computing
and software systems for emerging large-scale workloads such as linear algebra,
computational fluid dynamics and fast multipole methods. Currently, Mohammed is
a senior data engineer at KAPSARC, focusing on developing production-ready data
analytics solutions for in-house developed models for energy, economy, and
climate. Prior to that, Al Farhan was a postdoc at KAUST, where he worked with
David E. Keyes on developing scalable algorithms exploiting data sparsity in
dense matrices to bridge between architectures that are increasingly
memory-austere on a per-core basis and extreme-scale scientific applications.
Previously, Farhan was a postdoc at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville,
where he worked with Jack Dongarra on developing algorithms for dense linear
algebra on distributed, GPU-accelerated systems. He was part of the world's
leading Exascale Computing Project of the United States Department of Energy:
Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale (SLATE,

from KAUST. Al Farhan also spent time working as a software engineer at the
Saudi Electracity Compnay and Saudi Aramco.
