I am a postdoctoral researcher at the
[Extreme Computing Research Center (ECRC)](https://ecrc.kaust.edu.sa),
[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://kaust.edu.sa/en)

Methodologically, I develop scalable linear algebra methods that target
distributed, GPU-accelerated systems, such as communication-avoiding algorithms.
Substantively, I use such methods to exploit data sparsity in dense matrices to
bridge between architectures that are increasingly memory-austere on a per-core
basis and extreme-scale applications
