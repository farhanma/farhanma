Computer Scientist with long-time research experience in High Performance
Computing on several TOP500 supercomputers equipped with varieties of
heterogeneous system architectures.

Currently, I am a Senior Data Engineer at KAPSARC, focusing on developing
production-ready data analytics solutions for in-house developed models for
energy, economy, and climate.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at KAUST, where I worked with David
E. Keyes on developing scalable algorithms exploiting data sparsity in dense
matrices to bridge between architectures that are increasingly memory-austere on
a per-core basis and extreme-scale scientific applications.

Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville, where I worked with Jack Dongarra on developing algorithms for dense
linear algebra on distributed, GPU-accelerated systems. I was part of the world's
leading Exascale Computing Project of the United States Department of Energy:
Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale (SLATE, https://icl.utk.edu/slate/).

I received my PhD and MS in Computer Science from KAUST. I have also spent time
working as a Software Engineer at Saudi Electricity Company.

Before that, I received BS in Computer Science from King Faisal University. during
which I did two Software Engineering internships at Saudi Aramco.
