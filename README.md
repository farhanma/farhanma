I am a postdoc at the Extreme Computing Research Center, King Abdullah
University of Science and Technology (KAUST)

Methodologically, I develop scalable linear algebra methods that target
distributed, GPU-accelerated systems. Substantively, I use such methods to
exploit data sparsity in dense matrices to bridge between architectures that are
increasingly memory-austere on a per-core basis and extreme-scale scientific
applications.
