My career in computer science began with a bachelor's degree in the early 2010s,
driven by a deep fascination with networked and distributed systems, as well as
Unix/Linux. This passion led me to specialize in high-performance computing
(HPC), where I've dedicated over a decade to collaborating with scientists,
applied mathematicians, and researchers on solving intricate computational
challenges. Under the mentorship of Professor David E. Keyes, I earned both my
master's and PhD in computer science. Following my doctoral studies, I conducted
postdoctoral research first at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, under
Professor Jack Dongarra, and later at KAUST with Professor David E. Keyes.

My industry journey began with roles as a software engineer at the Saudi
Electricity Company and Saudi Aramco before pursuing advanced degrees. From 2019
to 2021, while working closely with Professor Jack Dongarra, I made significant
contributions to the Exascale Computing Project of the United States Department
of Energy, focusing specifically on Software for Linear Algebra Targeting
Exascale (SLATE). Throughout 2022, I continued my role as a senior research
engineer at KAPSARC, where I supported both researchers and enterprise
organizations.

Currently, I am honored to serve as a staff HPC deployment system engineer,
entrusted with the deployment, installation, configuration, and maintenance of
large-scale HPC & AI supercomputing solutions. My ongoing mission is to
facilitate advancements in both research and enterprise applications.
