I’m a senior technologist at HPE, leading the deployment, installation,
configuration, and support of supercomputing solutions for HPC & AI workloads.
Before this, I was a senior data engineer at KAPSARC and held postdoc roles at
KAUST with Prof. David E. Keyes and at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville
with Prof. Jack Dongarra. I also worked as a software engineer at Saudi
Electricity Company and Saudi Aramco.

Between 2019 and 2022, I contributed to the U.S. Department of Energy’s
Exascale Computing Project, focusing on the development of SLATE (Software
for Linear Algebra targeting Exascale, https://icl.utk.edu/slate/).

I hold a PhD, MS, and BSc in Computer Science.
