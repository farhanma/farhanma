I'm a postdoc at KAUST, developing scalable algorithms exploiting data sparsity
in dense matrices to bridge between architectures that are increasingly
memory-austere on a per-core basis and extreme-scale scientific applications.

Prior to that, I was a postdoc at University of Tennessee, worked with Jack
Dongarra to develop algorithms for dense linear algebra on distributed,
GPU-accelerated systems. I was part of the world's leading Exascale Computing
Project of the United States Department of Energy: Software for Linear Algebra
Targeting Exascale (SLATE, https://icl.utk.edu/slate/).
