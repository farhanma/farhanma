I am senior technologist at HPE responsible for the deployment, installation,
configuration, and support of supercomputing solutions designed for HPC&AI
workloads. Before this, I held roles as senior data engineer at KAPSARC, postdoc
at KAUST with Prof. David E. Keyes, postdoc at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville with Prof. Jack Dongarra, and software engineer at Saudi Electricity
Company and Saudi Aramco.

Between 2019 and 2021, I contributed to the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Exascale
Computing Project, specifically working on the SLATE initiative for software
targeting linear algebra at exascale (https://icl.utk.edu/slate/).
