My career in computer science began with a bachelor's degree in the early 2010s,
driven by a deep fascination with networked and distributed systems. This passion
led me to specialize in high-performance computing (HPC), where I have dedicated
over a decade to collaborating with computational scientists and applied
mathematicians on solving intricate scientific challenges at scale. Under the
mentorship of Professor David E. Keyes, I earned both my master's and PhD in
computer science. Following my doctoral studies, I conducted postdoctoral
research first at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, under Professor Jack
Dongarra, and later at KAUST with Professor David E. Keyes.

My industry journey began with roles as a software engineer at the Saudi
Electricity Company and Saudi Aramco before pursuing advanced degrees. From 2019
to 2021, while working closely with Professor Jack Dongarra, I made significant
contributions to the Exascale Computing Project of the United States Department
of Energy, focusing specifically on Software for Linear Algebra Targeting
Exascale (SLATE). Throughout 2022, I continued my role as a senior data engineer
at KAPSARC, where I developed and maintained data pipeline architecture for
energy, economy, and climate models.

Currently, I am a principal technologist at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE),
responsible for the deployment, installation, configuration, and support of
supercomputing solutions designed for HPC and AI workloads.
