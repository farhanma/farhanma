Mohammed Al Farhan is a computer scientist specialized in scientific computing
and software systems for emerging large-scale workloads such as linear algebra,
computational fluid dynamics and fast multipole methods. Currently, Mohammed is
HPC consultant at HPE, where he is responsible for monitoring, implementation,
and maintenance of large-scale systems optimized for HPC and AI workloads.
Previously, Al Farhan was a senior data engineer at KAPSARC, focusing on
developing production-ready data analytics solutions for in-house developed
models for energy, economy, and climate. Prior to that, Farhan was a postdoc at
KAUST, where he worked with David E. Keyes on developing scalable algorithms
exploiting data sparsity in dense matrices to bridge between architectures that
are increasingly memory-austere on a per-core basis and extreme-scale scientific
applications. Before that, Mohammed was a postdoc at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville, where he worked with Jack Dongarra on developing algorithms for dense
linear algebra on distributed, GPU-accelerated systems. He was part of the world's
leading Exascale Computing Project of the United States Department of Energy:
Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale (SLATE, https://icl.utk.edu/slate/).
Al Farhan received PhD and MS in computer science from KAUST, and BS in computer
science from King Faisal University. Farhan also spent time working as a software
engineer at the Saudi Electricity Company and Saudi Aramco.
